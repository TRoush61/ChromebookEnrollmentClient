# ChromebookEnrollmentClient

Repo is a WIP.

This Arduino client is a modified version of Amplified IT's Centipede, available here: https://labs.amplifiedit.com/centipede/.

This modified client is currently designed to be controlled via Bluetooth utilizing an HC05 Bluetooth module. It can be run standalone utilizing any Bluetooth serial communication method, but primary control is intended to be handled by the ChromebookEnrollmentServer, which will be made available soon. A preview of this functionality can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHTxe_h_T48.

Wiring diagram and further documentation will be fleshed out later once the design and code is in a more finalized state.
